## About Me

Computer Science undergraduate with a strong focus on Data Structures & Algorithms and core CS fundamentals.  
Currently building and experimenting with real-world projects.  
I enjoy writing clean, logical code and understanding how systems work under the hood.

Consistency > motivation. Learning one concept at a time.
